## 🎯 About the Project

**CampusBite** replaces the traditional paper-and-queue mess system with a **real-time, role-aware web application**. Every meal registration, QR scan, payment, complaint, inventory movement, and feedback rating is persisted in MongoDB and authorized server-side.

> *"Every button triggers a real API call backed by MongoDB. No mock data, no fake state."*

Built as a production-oriented MERN challenge, the project demonstrates:

- **Advanced RBAC** with four distinct roles and fine-grained route guards.
- **Refresh-token rotation** with HttpOnly secure cookies — no JWT in `localStorage`.
- **QR-based meal check-in** with signed, short-lived tokens and duplicate-scan prevention.
- **Dual mess systems**: pay-per-meal (1st Floor) and one-time semester fee (Ground Floor).
- **Admin-only pricing control** for per-meal rates and semester fees.
- **Socket.IO** live notifications for announcements, complaints, and kitchen alerts.
